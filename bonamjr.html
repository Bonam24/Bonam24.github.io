        <p id="parac">I have done several projects which have benefitted my community.
            My community projects consists of projects which have received external 
            funding and projects which have not received funding and have 
            been championed by me.

            <h4>Nkamlikum maths project</h4>
            <p>The world is in the fourth industrial revolution and my
                 community lack personnel with the required digital skills
                  to help the community reap the benefits which come with the 
                  fourth industrial revolution. This is because a lot students 
                  shy away from STEM majors. Less than 2 students in every 50 students
                 in my community consider studying computer science in high school because 
                 they do not understand mathematics. I have intervened in this by providing
                 students with toll free classes so that they can be able to gain interest in
                  mathematics and computer science</p>

            <p id="rpara"> Mbu Bakundu village is a remote commmunity which has not got a road since its existence
                Almost every child in that community is ignorant of ICT. 
                They do not even know that computers exists. This has been a challenge for several years.
                 In order to solve this i championed a project which solicited for funds from the Mastercard foundation
                to install a solar plate in the village. After this installation was done,
                 a computer and a tv were installed where children in that community so that students
                  can be exposed to basic ICT.</p>
